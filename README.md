# Book Writer
This is a tiny project I did in my spare time that writes complete books (though
filled with nonsense).

## Building
Just do:
```
make book_writer
```

## Dependencies
+ Just GHC

## Notes
+ This does not produce a cryptographically secure stream of words

## Bugs
+ Doesn't wrap lines properly
+ This is fairly slow. It is probably possible to make this significantly faster
